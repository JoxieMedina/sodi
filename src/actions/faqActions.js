This network aims to bridge the divide between existing disciplines, unify entities from all extant databases and repositories in one centralised repository of open data, and enable greater interdisciplinary communication and collaboration between scientific stakeholders worldwide.

                           By defining and constructing the infrastructure for a community-based initiative to interlink all entities and processes in our universe to relevant scientific disciplines, technologies, public organisations (universities, research centers, scientists) and research initiatives in one graph repository, SODI aims to map the space of scientific and technological progress, uncover meaningful connections, provide guidance and accelerate innovation across all fields of research, and ultimately push the very boundaries of human knowledge.
                           
                           SODI draws inspiration from the greatest multinational scientific megaprojects in the history of humankind, such as CERN’s high-energy physics research program, ITER’s experimental studies to produce fusion power, the Human Genome Project, Galaxy Zoo’s universe-spanning citizen science initiative, and of course, Wikipedia.
